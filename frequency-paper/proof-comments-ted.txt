Lise Getoor's work on Statistical Relational Models inspired us to consider class-level modelling with Parametrized Bayes nets; we thank her for helpful comments and encouragement.  Preliminary versions of this paper were presented at the SRL workshop at ICML 2012 and the ILP 2012 conference. We thank the organizers for providing a discussion venue, and the referees for constructive criticism. We thank Hector Levesque for extensive discussions of probability logic. This research was supported by NSERC Discovery Grants to Schulte and Kirkpatrick.
