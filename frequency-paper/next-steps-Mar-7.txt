1. Sections 2--5 have to be revised now that the "predicate and probability logic" has been moved to Section 6. The terms, "atom", "literal", "functor" and likely others are used before their definition. We need to decide which terms to use, define them briefly in Section 2, and edit Sections 2--5 to use those terms.

2. The description of the fast Möbius transform needs serious editing. The phrase "Möbius Parameter" is never defined and seems to be used inconsistently. We need to discuss how the algorithm handles attribute values and how that affects complexity (Reviewer 3 also requests this). The #P- comment in Section 4.2 needs details to be comprehensible.

3. I think we can improve the benefit by deciding clearly where it is important to distinguish parameterized Bayes nets from simple Bayes nets. Some formulas are agnostic about PBN/BN, while others are affected. (I think---either way, the paper would be improved by clarifying this.) I removed the phrase "functor Bayes nets". For this article, it just confuses things to introduce another phrase.  I kept the phrase, "functor nodes" because I think it is useful. (See #1 above.)
