  abstract = {Inductive Logic Programming is a young and rapidly growing field combining
	machine learning and logic programming. This self-contained tutorial
	is the first theoretical introduction to ILP; it provides the reader
	with a rigorous and sufficiently broad basis for future research
	in the area. In the first part, a thorough treatment of first-order
	logic, resolution-based theorem proving, and logic programming is
	given. The second part introduces the main concepts of ILP and systematically
	develops the most important results on model inference, inverse resolution,
	unfolding, refinement operators, least generalizations, and ways
	to deal with background knowledge. Furthermore, the authors give
	an overview of PAC learning results in ILP and of some of the most
	relevant implemented systems. },
