You must install two components to run Proximity:
  - a Proximity client
  - a MonetDB server (the database back-end for Proximity)
This document describes how to download and install both of these components.

Proximity 4.3 operates with MonetDB 4.6.2 and selected later versions:

  * New users should download and install MonetDB 4.18.2 (Windows) or 
    4.20 (Linux/Mac OS X) (the "mars" versions)

  * Users updating from Proximity 4.0 or later can stay with MonetDB 4.6.2
    or update to Monet 4.18.2 (Windows) or 4.20 (Linux/Mac OS X).  The
    later MonetDB versions provide some performance improvements, but
    using these versions requires converting existing databases.  See
    "Updating MonetDB databases" later in this document for additional
    information on updating databases.

  * Users updating from Proximity 3.1 or earlier must update their
    MonetDB installation and update their databases.  Please contact
    Proximity technical support at proximity-support@kdl.cs.umass.edu
    for assistance if you are updating from Proximity 3.1 or earlier.

  ---------------------------------------------------------
  |  Proximity 4.3 is NOT yet fully compatible with the   |
  |  latest release of MonetDB 5.                         |

======================================================================
Client (Proximity) installation
======================================================================

Note: Since version 4.1, the Proximity client changes the root
      Proximity directory from "proximity3" to "proximity."

The Proximity client requires Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition, v1.5
(J2SE) or later.

To install the Proximity client, follow these steps:

  1.  Download the Proximity client distribution (proximity-4.3.tgz)
      from http://kdl.cs.umass.edu/proximity/downloads.html.

  2.  Extract the tarball to the desired location.

      On Unix-based systems, use the tar command:

         $ tar xvfz ~/proximity-4.3.tgz

      You must use a version of tar (e.g., GNU tar) that supports long
      filenames.

      On Windows, unpack the file with WinZip or an equivalent application.

  3a. On Unix-based systems, change the permissions of the bin/ directory with
      the following command:

         $ cd proximity/
         $ chmod -R a+x bin/

  3b. On Windows systems, set the PROX_HOME environment variable to the
      Proximity installation directory.  For example, if you have installed
      Proximity in C:\Proximity\, then you would set

         PROX_HOME=C:\Proximity\

      The way you set this variable will vary depending on your version
      of Windows.

To get started using Proximity, see the tutorial in either
   - proximity/doc/user/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf
   - proximity/doc/user/tutorial/HTML/index.html 

======================================================================
Server (MonetDB) installation
======================================================================

In order to run the Proximity client you need to install the MonetDB server. 
Follow the appropriate instructions below for installing MonetDB for
Unix-style platforms (including Mac OS X) or Windows.

Installing MonetDB for Unix-style platforms:
--------------------------------------------

   You must have administrator privileges to install MonetDB; log in
   as root (Unix/Linux) or use sudo (Mac).

  1. Download the binary distribution for your platform from
     http://kdl.cs.umass.edu/proximity/downloads.html.

        Linux on Intel:       monet-mars-distr-linux.tgz
        Linux on Intel 64:    monet-mars-distr-linux-64.tgz
        Mac OS X on PPC:      monet-mars-distr-mac-ppc.tgz
        Mac OS X on PPC-64:   monet-mars-distr-mac-ppc-64.tgz
        Mac OS X on Intel:    monet-mars-distr-mac-intel.tgz

     Although we recommend that new users install one of the "mars"
     distributions, we also continue to provide MonetDB 4.6.2, as well.

  2. Extract the tarball to your /usr/local/ directory.
     (NOTE: this binary distribution of MonetDB is not relocatable!)

        $ cd /usr/local
        $ tar xvfz ~/monet-mars-distr-[platform].tgz

  3. Change the permissions of the var/ directory with the following
     command (also requires administrator privileges):

        $ cd Monet-mars/
        $ chmod -R a+w var/

The MonetDB server is run from a terminal window.  To start the
MonetDB server, use:

        $ /usr/local/Monet-mars/bin/Mserver

You can optionally add /usr/local/Monet-mars/bin to PATH.

Running the server without specifying a database connects to the demo database.
To start the server on a particular database, use:

        $ Mserver --dbname <db_name> <prox_home>/resources/init-mserver.mil

     where <db_name> is the database name and <prox_home> is the location
     of your local Proximity installation.

Proximity uses the port number to select the appropriate protocol for
the version of MonetDB being used.  You must use a port number <= 40000 
for the "mars" versions (4.20 and 4.18.2), and a port number > 40000
for MonetDB 4.6.2.  To run the server on a different port number, use
(all on one line):

        $ Mserver --dbname <db_name> <prox_home>/resources/init-mserver.mil
          --set port=<nnnnn>

     where <nnnnn> is the new port number.

To quit the MonetDB server, use:

        MonetDB> quit();

     where "MonetDB>" is the Monet server prompt and "quit();" is the command 
     (note the parentheses and semi-colon) 

See the Proximity tutorial for additional information on using the MonetDB
server for Proximity.  MonetDB documentation is available from CWI's website at
http://monetdb.cwi.nl/projects/monetdb/MonetDB/Version4/Documentation/index.html


Installing MonetDB for Windows platforms:
-----------------------------------------

The Windows MonetDB distribution requires Windows Professional 2000 or
later (not 98 nor ME).

  1. If you have an older version of MonetDB already installed on your system,
     remove the following DLL files from the C:\WINDOWS\System32\ directory:

        1. libstream.dll
        2. libmutils.dll
        3. libMonetODBCs.dll
        4. libMonetODBC.dll
        5. libMapi.dll

  2. Download the binary distribution for your platform from
     http://kdl.cs.umass.edu/proximity/downloads.html.

        Windows:             monet-mars-distr-win.msi
        Windows 64:          monet-mars-distr-win-64.msi

     Although we recommend that new users install the "mars"
     distribution, we also continue to provide MonetDB 4.6.2, as well.

  3. As an administrator, run the Microsoft installer for MonetDB,
     monet-mars-distr-win.msi, by double-clicking the file name to
     start the installation wizard.  Follow the instructions to
     install the server in the desired location.  The default 
     installation directory is C:\Program Files\CWI\MonetDB4.

     The choice of installing MonetDB for "Just me" or "All users"
     affects only whether MonetDB is added to the Start Menu for the
     current user or for all users.  In all cases, MonetDB stores its
     databases in 
        C:\\Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\MonetDB4\dbfarm\
     where <username> is the name of the current user.

  4. As an administrator, run Mserver.bat (located in the installation
     directory). This creates the required directory hierarchy for
     MonetDB databases.

  5. Quit the MonetDB server with

        MonetDB> quit();

     where "MonetDB>" is the MonetDB server prompt and "quit();" is the
     command (note the parentheses and semi-colon) 

The MonetDB server is run from the command (DOS) window.  To start the
MonetDB server, use the following command (substitute the appropriate
path if you installed the server someplace other than the default location):

        > "C:\Program Files\CWI\MonetDB4\Mserver.bat"

You can optionally add the MonetDB installation directory to PATH.  You
may need to restart your command window to have this update available. 

Running the server without specifying a database connects to the demo
database.  To start the server on a particular database, use the
following command (all on one line):

        > "C:\Program Files\CWI\MonetDB4\Mserver.bat" --dbname <db_name>
          "<prox_home>\resources\init-mserver.mil"

     where <db_name> is the database name and <prox_home> is the location
     of your local Proximity installation.

Proximity uses the port number to select the appropriate protocol for
the version of MonetDB being used.  You must use a port number <= 40000 
for the "mars" versions (4.20 and 4.18.2), and a port number > 40000
for MonetDB 4.6.2.  To run the server on a different port number, use
(all on one line):

        > "C:\Program Files\CWI\MonetDB4\Mserver.bat" --dbname <db_name>
          "<prox_home>\resources\init-mserver.mil" --set port=<nnnnn>

     where <nnnnn> is the new port number.

To quit the MonetDB server, use:

        MonetDB> quit();

See the Proximity tutorial for additional information on using the MonetDB
server for Proximity.  MonetDB documentation is available from CWI's website
http://monetdb.cwi.nl/projects/monetdb/MonetDB/Version4/Documentation/index.html


======================================================================
Updating MonetDB databases
======================================================================

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  |  Users updating from Proximity 4.0 or later can continue to use  |
  |  their current MonetDB installation and existing MonetDB         |
  |  databases and safely ignore this section.  However, if you      |
  |  choose to update to a newer version of MonetDB, you must also   |
  |  update your databases to use the new database format.           |
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

Proximity 4.3 is fully compatible with MonetDB 4.6.2 (the version of
Monet distributed with Proximity 4.0 through 4.2).  Current Proximity
users may either stay with their existing MonetDB installation or
update to MonetDB 4.18.2 (Windows) or 4.20 (Linux/OS X) (the "mars"
versions).  This update provides some performance improvements over
MonetDB 4.6.2.

To update databases to a newer version of MonetDB, simply export the
data to the Proximity plain text or XML data format and then re-import
it into the new database.  For most import or export operations, we
recommend using the more robust Proximity XML format in order to take
advantage of its error checking capabilities.  In this case, because
you are importing unchanged data exported from Proximity, the use of
the plain text format is recommended for performance reasons.

  -----------------------------------------------------------
  |  Users updating to Proximity 4.3 from Proximity 3.1 or  |
  |  earlier should contact Proximity technical support at  |
  |  proximity-support@kdl.cs.umass.edu for assistance.     |
  -----------------------------------------------------------

Updating databases using plain text:
------------------------------------

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  |  Do not delete your installation of MonetDB 4.6.2 until  |
  |  you have completed updating all databases.              |
  ------------------------------------------------------------

  1. Install the new versions of MonetDB and Proximity, following the
     instructions above. Do not delete MonetDB 4.6.2.
 
  2. Serve the database using MonetDB 4.6.2 (all on one line):

        $ /usr/local/Monet-46/bin/Mserver --dbname <db_name> 
          <prox_home>/resources/init-mserver.mil --set port=45678

     where <db_name> is the database name and <prox_home> is the
     location of your local Proximity installation.  Using a port
     number > 40000 tells Proximity to use the MonetDB 4.6.2 protocol.

     (Windows users should substitute the appropriate path to their
     MonetDB 4.6.2 installation's Mserver command.)

  3. Export the data to plain text files. You can only export data to the
     same machine as that serving the database.

        $ <prox_home>/bin/export-text.sh localhost:45678 <data_dir>

        where <port_num> is the number of the port used to serve the
        database and <data_dir> is the absolute pate to the directory
        that will hold the exported plain text data files.  

        (Windows users should use export-text.bat instead of export-text.sh.)

  4. Quit the MonetDB server.

        MonetDB> quit();

  5. Serve the new (empty) database.  Make sure that you use the
     correct path to the new Mserver command, either by changing PATH
     or by explicitly including the path on the command line.

        $ /usr/local/Monet-mars/bin/Mserver --dbname <db_name>
          <prox_home>/resources/init-mserver.mil

     where <db_name> is the database name.  Note that Proximity 4.3
     changes the default port number to '30000'.  (Proximity 4.3 requires
     a port number <= 40000 for MonetDB Mars.)

     (Windows users should substitute the appropriate path to their
     MonetDB 4.18.2 installation's Mserver command.)

  6. Initialize the new database.

        $ <prox_home>/bin db-util.sh localhost:30000 init-db

        (Windows users should use db-util.bat instead of db-util.sh.)

  7. Import the plain text data. You can only import data residing on the
     same machine as that serving the database.

        $ <prox_home>/bin/import-text.sh localhost:30000 <data_dir>

        where <data_dir> is the absolute path to the directory
        containing the plain text data files created in step 2.

        (Windows users should use import-text.bat instead of import-text.sh.)

See "Chapter 3: Iporting and Exporting Proximity Data" in the
Proximity Tutorial for additional information on using the plain text
format to export and import data.


Location of database files:
---------------------------

MonetDB Mars stores database files in a different directory than that 
used by earlier versions of MonetDB.

  - Database files for Linux and Macintosh installations are stored in

       /usr/local/Monet-mars/var/MonetDB4/dbfarm

  - Database files for Windows installations are stored in

       C:\\Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\MonetDB4\dbfarm

    where <username> is the login name of the user who installed MonetDB.


Backward compatibility:
-----------------------

Databases converted to MonetDB Mars may not be usable in older versions
of MonetDB.  We recommend that you backup any database that you might
want to use in an older version of MonetDB before converting it to
MonetDB Mars.
