            It helps human analysts discover new knowledge by analyzing 
            complex data sets about people, places, things, and events. New
            developments in this area are vital because of the growing interest in
            analyzing the Web, social networks, telecommunications and computer
            networks, relational and object-oriented databases,  multi-agent
            systems, and other sources of structured and semi-structured data.

            Proximity consists of novel algorithms that help manage, explore,
            sample, model, and visualize data.  Proximity implements methods for
            learning statistical models that describe the probabilistic dependencies
            in relational data and can estimate probability distributions over
            unseen data.  Proximity is an open-source application developed in
            Java, and it makes substantial use of MonetDB

               First-generation tools for knowledge discovery are already widely
               deployed in business, science, and government. These tools help
               epidemiologists identify emerging diseases, help engineers improve
               industrial processes, and help credit-card companies spot fraud.
               
            </p>
            <p>
               Unfortunately, much of the technical work in knowledge discovery, and
               its underlying statistical theory, assumes that data records are
               structurally
               <a class="indexterm" name="d0e102"></a>
               <a class="indexterm" name="d0e106"></a>
               <a class="indexterm" name="d0e110"></a>
               <a class="indexterm" name="d0e116"></a>
               homogeneous and 
               <a xmlns:exsl="http://exslt.org/common" href="go01.html#d18e742"><span class="glossterm">statistically independent</span></a>. 
               For example,
               to analyze a set of patient records to determine useful diagnostic
               rules for a new disease, traditional techniques would assume that the
               records provide the same type of information about each patient and
               that knowing something about one patient tells you nothing about
               another.  Good work in epidemiology, however, regularly considers
               records of many types (e.g., patients, workplaces, industrial
               chemicals) as well as relationships among those records (genetic
               and social relationships among patients, occupational exposure of
               patients to chemicals, etc.).
               
            </p>
            <p>
               Ignoring this relational information vastly oversimplifies many
               problems and can make their deep structure all but
               undiscoverable. Indeed, the importance of such relational information
               is precisely what led computer scientists to create relational
               databases and knowledge representations based on first-order logic. To
               date, however, most technologies for knowledge discovery have lagged
               behind these decades-old innovations, only addressing the data
               contained in a single database table and only expressing concepts in
               representations roughly equivalent to propositional logic.
               
            </p>
            <p>
               Addressing fully relational tasks has raised a remarkable array of new
               problems in statistical inference, required the development of new
               technologies for knowledge discovery, and raised new questions about
               the assessment and management of these technologies. The need to
               investigate these interconnected questions has driven the work of the
               Knowledge Discovery Laboratory (KDL) at the University of
               Massachusetts Amherst, and the desire to disseminate our findings led
               us to create Proximity.
