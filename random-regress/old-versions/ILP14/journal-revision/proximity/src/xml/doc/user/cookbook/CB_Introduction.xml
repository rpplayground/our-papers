scripts for common or prototypical Proximity tasks. These scripts are
designed to serve as models for you to modify to meet your specific
needs.  Each &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; includes extensive discussion of the
classes, methods, and data structures used in its accompanying
script.</para>

<para>The <citetitle>Proximity Cookbook</citetitle> is currently in
