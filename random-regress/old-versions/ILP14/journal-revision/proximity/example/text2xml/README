Part of the open-source Proximity system (see LICENSE for copyright
and license information).

This directory contains example files that show how to use the perl
script text2xml.pl, which translates data from appropriately formatted
text files into an xml file that can be imported into Proximity 3.

Both the script itself and the .dtd it requires have to be in the same
directory as the input files.  This can be achieved by making local
copies in the directory where you have created your input files (or in
this example directory, if you want to run the example yourself).  You
can copy the script from
   proximity3/bin/text2xml.pl
and the .dtd from
   proximity3/resources/prox3db.dtd

Now you are ready to run the script.  Usage:

perl text2xml.pl text2xml-example osf.com lsf.com comma
OR
perl text2xml.pl text2xml-example osf.tab lsf.tab tab

produces the file text2xml-example.xml.

The *.com files and *.tab files contain the same data; the only
difference is the separator character that separates the fields.
Space would not be a legal separator character in this example because
several of the data fields contain spaces.

See proximity3/doc/user/text2xml/text2xml.txt for further information
about how to format the input files for text2xml.pl.
