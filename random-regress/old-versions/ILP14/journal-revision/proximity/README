New features in Proximity 4.3

This is a major release of Proximity, with many improvements:

Support for newer versions of Monet (4.16 to 4.20), which fix
important problems with TCP/IP communication, effectively making
Proximity almost an order of magnitude faster.

Completely re-written model code (RBC, RPT, RDN), with a much
cleaner, more modular, and faster implementation of the modeling
engine.

A new RPT Viewer that displays more detailed information of the new
RPTs built, such as the percentage of cases that fall on each branch
of splits.

A new visualization tool for displaying the database in a radial
layout, with animation. Used also to visualize subgraphs.

A new DataGeneration package, capable of generating several different
kinds of graphs (random graphs, lattices, grids, forest fires, etc),
as well as attributes on objects and links.

New utilities to export a database to text files, and to import from
text files, with orders of magnitude speed improvement over XML
import/export.

New Proximity Cookbook documentation containing "recipes" for
common/prototypical Proximity tasks (in development, preliminary
version released)


See the Tutorial and HISTORY file for additional details on the new
features in Proximity 4.3.


=============================================================
Changes from Proximity 4.2

Proximity 4.3 is fully compatible with MonetDB 4.6.2 (the version of
Monet distributed with Proximity 4.0 through 4.2), and current
Proximity users may choose to stay with their existing MonetDB
installation and databases.

New Proximity users, or users concerned with performance, are
encouraged to switch to MonetDB 4.18.2 (Windows) or 4.20 (Linux/Mac OS X)
(the "mars" versions). These new MonetDB versions provide some
performance improvements, but using these versions requires converting
existing databases.  See "Updating MonetDB databases" in the
INSTALL document for additional information on updating databases.

Note that Proximity 4.3 now uses the port number to select the
appropriate protocol for the version of MonetDB being used.  You must
use a port number <= 40000 for the "mars" versions (4.20 and 4.18.2),
and a port number > 40000 for MonetDB 4.6.2.  The new default is port
30000, which works with the new versions of Monet. To run the server
on a different port number, use (all on one line):

        $ Mserver --dbname <db_name> <prox_home>/resources/init-mserver.mil
          --set port=<nnnnn>

     where <nnnnn> is the new port number.


This new release makes use of two new third-party libraries:

- JUNG (http://jung.sourceforge.net/), a graph data structure
  and visualization package
- Mantissa (http://www.spaceroots.org), a Mathematical Library


See the HISTORY file for additional details on changes and bug fixes

Technical support

  Please send all requests for general technical support to
  proximity-support@kdl.cs.umass.edu.

  Please send any bug reports including documentation errors to
  proximity-bugs@kdl.cs.umass.edu.

  Please send general comments, suggestions, and criticism to
  proximity@kdl.cs.umass.edu.


=============================================================
Mailing lists

There are two Proximity mailing lists:

  proximity-announce
     Only major project and other milestone announcements will be made
     on this list (very low traffic). Posting rights are limited to
     KDL staff.

  proximity-list
     Questions, suggestions, and general technical discussion should
     be made on this list. You must be a list subscriber to post.

See http://kdl.cs.umass.edu/proximity/mailing-lists.html for information
on subscribing to these lists.


=============================================================
Documentation

  Proximity 4.3 includes documentation in the form of the Proximity
  Tutorial, QGraph Guide, and Proximity Cookbook. All documents are
  available in both HTML and PDF in the proximity/doc/user/ directory.

  The Tutorial includes instructions and example files for completing
  common Proximity tasks including
    - importing and exporting data into and out of Proximity
    - using the Proximity Database Browser
    - creating and executing QGraph queries
    - writing and running Proximity Python scripts including
        * creating new attributes
        * generating synthetic data
        * working with NSTs (internal Proximity data structures)
    - learning and applying relational classification models
  The Proximity Tutorial is available at
    - proximity/doc/user/tutorial/HTML/index.html
    - proximity/doc/user/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf

  The QGraph Guide provides a complete description of the QGraph query
  language. Numerous examples illustrate how QGraph uses graph
  structure, conditions, annotations, and constraints to match queries
  to database structures.
  The Proximity QGraph Guide is available at
    - proximity/doc/user/qgraph/HTML/index.html
    - proximity/doc/user/qgraph/QGraphGuide.pdf

  The Proximity Cookbook is in development with a preliminary version
  included with this release.  The Cookbook provides detailed code
  examples of how to accomplish common/prototypical Proximity tasks
  including
    - creating new data entities (links, attributes)
    - aggregating data from multiple entities
    - creating subsets of containers efficiently
    - importing data when IDs conflict with existing data
    - configuring the logging utility (log4j)
  The Proximity Cookbook is available at
    - proximity/doc/user/cookbook/HTML/index.html
    - proximity/doc/user/cookbook/ProxCookbook.pdf

=============================================================
Importing data from previous Proximity releases into Proximity 4.3

See "Changes from Proximity 4.2" for an explanation of new changes to
the Proximity database requirements.

See INSTALL for instructions on updating databases from previous version
of Proximity.
